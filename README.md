Ecommerce Follow Along Project
Welcome to the Ecommerce Follow Along Project, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

Milestone 1: Project Overview
1. Understanding the MERN Stack:
MongoDB : A database for storing application data in a flexible, document based format. Express.js : A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics. React.js : A framework library for building User Interfaces. Node.js : A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend. We'll create APIs for:

User Authentication: Allowing users to register and log in.
Product Management: Adding, Updating, and Retrieving products data.
Order Handling: Managing customer orders.
3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.

4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:

Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.~
SECTION 2:
Milestone 2: In this I create a react app and design the login page and style it Tailwindcss. It gives a wonderful Experience and i get some knowledge that how to work on a professional project.

Milestone 3:
Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests. Connected the application to MongoDB to store and manage data. Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation.

Milestone 4:
Created a User Model to define how user data is structured in the database also developed a user interactions, like adding or retrieving data. Additionally, configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to store files such as images.

Milestone 5:
In this I create a react app and design the signup page and style it Tailwindcss. It gives a wonderful Experience and i get some knowledge that how to work on a professional project.

Milestone 6:
In this milestone, we created a backend endpoint to securely store user data during signup. Key features include:

Password Encryption: Encrypting passwords before storing them in the database to enhance security.
Secure Data Storage: Saving user details while following best security practices.
Compliance: Ensuring password protection aligns with security laws like GDPR and PCI-DSS.
